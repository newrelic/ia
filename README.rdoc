= New Relic Infrastructure Agent

Gem for collecting memcached, disk, cpu and IO statistics.  Collected
stats are sent to the New Relic RPM application.

Use this gem to collect statistics from a given host by running
newrelic_ia -a as a daemon.  This will contribute System/* metrics
to your RPM console which can be viewed with custom dashboards.

== Synopsis

    newrelic_ia [ options ] aspect, aspect..

    aspect: one or more of 'iostat' or 'disk' or 'memcached' (more to come)

    -a, --all                        use all available aspects
    -v, --verbose                    debug output
    -q, --quiet                      quiet output
    -e, --environment=ENV            use ENV section in newrelic.yml
        --install KEY                create a default newrelic.yml
    -h, --help                       Show this help message.

== Requirements

* New Relic Agent version 2.10.6 or later
* Gold Subscription for creating and viewing custom dashboards

== Install

    sudo gem install newrelic_ia

Once installed, run from the home directory of your Rails
application, or create a separate working directory and run

    newrelic_ia --install KEY

to create a template newrelic.yml file you can use.  Edit this file
and substitute your license key and app_name value.

specify memcached nodes in memcached-nodes.txt.

== Credits

Special thanks to Chandra Patni and Tony Ford of IGN for the Memcached
sampler.

== Memcached Details

Memcached statistics sampler collects subset of stats provided by
memcached daemon, once a minute.  In addition it computes other stats
dervied from memcached stats. Also support stats derivatives over time
to compute rate etc.  Specify Memcached nodes configuration in the
newrelic.yml file.

Memcached stats are reported for each node and also sample reports aggregated stats
